Eye-of-Harmony
==============

A data analysis meta package/framework tying up the different analysis steps.

The Goal
==============
The goal is to create a framework/meta-package which ties up the different components 
that make up a particle physics analysis:

1. Preparation of data (map/copy/stream)
2. Data analysis (calculations)
3. Storage of results (reduce/store)
4. Data presentation (plots/tables)
5. Data publication (copy to web-server, notify)

These steps are usually performed with different software (in different frameworks, etc) 
and add to the complexity of the analysis.
