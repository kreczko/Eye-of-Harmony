==============

A data analysis ~~meta package/framework~~ aggregator tying up the different analysis steps.

The Goal
==============
The goal is to create a ~~framework/meta-package~~ aggregator which ties up the different components 
that make up a particle physics analysis:

1. Preparation of data (map/copy/stream)
2. Verification
3. Data analysis (calculations)
4. Storage of results (reduce/store)
5. Data presentation (plots/tables)
6. Data publication (copy to web-server, notify)

These steps are usually performed with different software (in different frameworks, etc) 
and add to the complexity of the analysis. So lets try and take the complexity away.
